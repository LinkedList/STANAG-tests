<p>A group of Italian biochemists from Pavia have developed a pill that contains the same beneficial components found in red wine. Nutrition experts have long been convinced that the moderate consumption of red wine aids in the functioning of the human heart. It is said that a glass of red wine daily cleans arteries, and that it also decreases the risk of dementia and cancer. The pill contains a combination of sugar, amino acids, and other components of red wine, but does not contain any alcohol, thereby offering non-drinkers the same health-giving properties.</p>

<p>Twelve sheep belonging to a rancher in Alaverez were killed last night by a stray dog. The sheep had an estimated market value of $8000. “The dog got through the gate to the pasture while I was away and killed seven sheep and five lambs,” said the owner, Dick Bass, who was able to catch the dog. Police are now looking for its owner. “This is a dog no one has seen before. It’s possible that it swam across the river from Mexico,” said Bass.</p>

<p>The French government is considering a fee for operating a private vehicle in Paris as has been introduced in London. This would reduce choking pollution, which has pushed the capital close to emergency traffic restrictions, a government minister said Friday. “An urban toll is one solution,” Ecology Minister Louise Pierrot told Europe 1 radio as Paris braced for another day of high ozone and carbon dioxide levels. “All aspects of the London experience are worth studying.” On Monday, a number of European cities, including Paris, will participate in a sixth annual “day without cars,” with access to many parts of the cities blocked to motorists.</p>

<h3>21. A reader’s response to an article</h3>
<p>I feel obliged to respond to your article, “An American Family Goes to War,” about the first husband and wife battalion commanders leaving their 14 year-old daughter behind. There is nothing admirable about a mother whose devotion to her job makes her leave her child behind in the care of friends. When mothers are so absorbed in their careers, their children become just something to be managed while they are away. I have no quarrel with women in the military as such, but I do have a problem with mothers who cannot take care of their children.</p>

<h3>22. A comment by a spokesperson from the Ministry of Defense</h3>
<p>When troops occupy people from another culture, even a bit of local resistance often creates havoc. The guerrilla fighters strike from out of the neighborhoods, killing soldiers, whose units naturally respond with tightened security. That response antagonizes average citizens, who find themselves delayed, searched, and sometimes taken into custody as they attempt to pursue their daily lives.</p>

<p>One government soldier was killed and another wounded in a six-hour firefight that followed the rebel ambush of a convoy on Monday. The battle was unusually long because the convoy didn’t flee the scene of the attack once it came under fire, but instead, managed to hold the enemy off and call in armored reinforcements. Although it took several hours for the additional troops to arrive, government forces eventually chased the rebels into a nearby village and, using Bradley fighting vehicles supported by attack helicopters, routed or destroyed them.</p>

<p>The strains of Mozart, Bach, and Beethoven played in restaurants make diners feel more affluent and encourage them to spend, according to researcher Adrian North of London University. If you hear classical music, it has got all sorts of connotations of sophistication, affluence, and generosity, and it makes you feel a bit posh. With pop music in the background, diners spend about ten percent less on average, and with no background music it was even lower.</p>

<p>As researchers learn more about how children’s intelligence develops, they are increasingly surprised by the power of parents. The power of the school has been replaced by the home. To begin with, all the factors which are part of intelligence – the child’s understanding of language, learning patterns, curiosity – are established well before the child enters school at the age of six. Study after study has shown that even after school begins, children’s achievements have been far more influenced by parents than by teachers.</p>

<p>One of the most common assumptions of psychology is that, in times of crisis, women turn to friends, while men withdraw. Although the male response has been rigorously examined, psychologists are only now beginning to focus on women’s reactions. Recent findings suggest that a woman’s social network is more than just a diversion: it is basic to the survival of the species. A correlation has been found between the social network of an expectant mother and the birth weight of her baby. Scientists have also found that mothers who develop the most elaborate social networks tend to raise children with lower mortality rates.</p>

<p>Nicotine itself is a powerful drug, and the properties that make it addictive may also help ease symptoms of mental disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. At a meeting in Washington last week, scientists added other illnesses to the list. One of them studied seventy teenagers with Touret’s syndrome. Those who wore nicotine patches along with the normal treatment, a tranquilizer, showed significant decrease in the involuntary muscle activity associated with the disease. Scientists hope that new drugs designed to imitate nicotine’s positive effects will become another weapon in the fight against debilitating disorders.</p>

<p>In eastern North America, people worked for hundreds of years to develop a variety of corn that could grow farther north than central Mexico, where it originated. There was an enormous incentive to grow corn, because it produced more food per planted seed than any other crop known at the time. So, when the new variety was perfected about A.D. 800, it quickly spread throughout the East and into the Midwestern plains.</p>

<p>Our fear of making mistakes is one reason we find it so difficult to make the necessary repairs to our political, economic, and social systems. As de Bono notes, “The pressure to be right at every stage and all the time is probably the biggest barrier there is to new ideas.” In the scientific and creative spheres, innovation arises out of trial and error; without a similar commitment in government there will be few breakthroughs in solving our country’s larger problems. While politicians live in dread of making any wrong turn (partly because their constituents are ready to pounce on them for the slightest failure), others know they may have to try many potential solutions before coming across something that works.</p>

<p>An austere home in a dusty alleyway, and the man who has not stepped outside its walls in six years, have become a center of power here in recent weeks. Men who visit the reclusive cleric, Shihab, deliver their opinions on various issues; they are clearly seeking his backing in the current political free-for-all, with many factions competing for a share in the coming government. Any endorsement from Shihab instantly bestows legitimacy in the eyes of the religious community; his support can win votes for politicians and will weigh heavily on further plans for a new government.</p>
